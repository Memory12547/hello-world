# hello-world
Hello world 

I appear to be, again, still 
In human form. 

What a gift 
I feel my body stretch 
As it wakes up 
From attempted slumber. 

I hear a baby laughing 
Who an hour ago 
Was crying. 
It feels like joy in my heart 
To hear this sound. 

Hello world 
I appear to be on a plane. 
What a wondrous invention 
This vehicle that flies 
Through air 
So much faster than you or I could ever cover on foot. 

Bless 
Those souls who were brave enough 
Who are brave enough 
To create new ‘things’ into being 
From their imagination only 
Despite the likely discouragement 
From those who cannot see what they see. 

Bless. 

I feel blessed 
To be in human form. 
To see, experience, feel 
All that I’m able with this body 
This heart, this skin 
Perceived with this mind. 

Here is to every day that I get another.
